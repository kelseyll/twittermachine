"thank you @Bandcamp for all of the new music 🙏🏾 you really pulled january out of the trash"

"i always pay more than asking price on @Bandcamp because it's truly not a big difference to add $5 or whatever.. for me a small but meaningful way to demonstrate that i appreciate what you've made, that your work has value, that art has value."

"If we decided to burn the entire internet to the ground tomorrow, Bandcamp would be the only thing I would try to protect. You. Are. The. Best."

"we don't deserve bandcamp"

"Hello all non-musicians, campaign peeps, music fans! @Bandcamp is EXCELLENT, their moral standards are HIGH, and their overhead is LOW. On Friday, 100% of your digital purchase goes directly to the independent artist who has music for sale here. Support musicians HERE, it is REAL"

"Bandcamp is the best thing that happened to indie music these last couple of years. Hats off 🌹"

"Just @Bandcamp being absolute rides yet again 💙🤘"
